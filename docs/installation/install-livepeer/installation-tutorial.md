This tutorial includes a brief overview of how Livepeer works with contextual information about the steps to setup a Livepeer Orchestrator. 

It aims to guide those new to the Livepeer and are interested in learning about how participating on the Livepeer network earn passive income utilizing your GPUs for video mining.

## About video mining on Livepeer

Our [Architecture](/video-miners/core-concepts/architecture) allows you to set up various options--architectures to perform video-mining services.

Orchestrator -- is a node set up to work in the Livepeer ecosystem to provide transcoding systems. up with transcoders encoding into pixel rates, e.g. bit rates such as 1080, 720, 

Your GPUs can be set up simply to transcode on the network or you can set up an Orchestrator, a node and transcode work, or include others who have set up their GPUs to simply transcode on the network with an Orchestrator.

Ideally, you want your GPU to be able to process as many streams encoding/transcoding quickly, with the capacity to process streams at the highest resolution possible.

Transcoding takes input as video, decoding to raw formated video and encoding into different formats and bit rates (144p,240p , 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p HD) and quality rates 0.38 GB/hr, 1.40 GB/hr, 6.84 GB/hr

You may already be an [ETH Miner](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/#what-is-ethereum-mining) or not, and if you add your GPU on the Livepeer network to perform transcoding, or run a node with multiple transcoders, with your own GPU(s) or with those who are on the network, and earn [ETH](https://bitflyer.com/en-us/ethereum-chart) fees. instead of solving proof-of-work algorithms you will earn ETH with your GPU working to decodes and encodes video

## About Livepeer Installation

The following covers information to keep in mind as you go through the steps of an installation.

It is based on the video tutorial [How to set up a Livepeer Orchestrator](https://youtu.be/-gfSkX5xL-U) from the [Livepeer Academy](https://livepeer.academy/video-tutorials/)

**Note** This tutorial is for a Windows machine, from which you should be able to glean the information needed for your implementation.

### Consideration and Recommendations

Familiarity with [Livepeer Concepts](/video-miners/core-concepts/overview)

### Transcoding

Device converts video from one format to another, OTT or ABR, one masterfile or mezanine stream to other formats or resolutions, in other words transmit video accross the network to different devices, you use use the transcoder to convert video to all formats and resolutions you need to support

After production of a video, it's transcoded in different formats to be sent of a cdn to end user devises, and convert stream over LAN or WAN (network) 

#### Encoding and Decoding

Technical understanding of how encoding and decoding works.

- Encoding Types

	- Live
	Live video encoding is the process of compressing large, raw video and audio files so that they use less network bandwidth. When it comes to transporting uncompressed raw video, this can mean a colossal amount of data to send over any connection. Given the constant struggle for bandwidth efficiency, compression significantly reduces the bandwidth required, making it possible for real-time video streams or files to be easily transmitted across constrained networks such as the public internet.


	- File Based
	encoders are used to compress and reduce the size of video content so that it can take up less storage space and be easier to transfer from one part of a video production workflow to another.

	To achieve these levels of compression, video encoders use video compression algorithms known as codecs (such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC) can reduce the raw content data by as much as 1,000 times.

- Codecs
	
	A way to compress and decompress a sequence of images
	For example, A codec based on the H.264 standard compresses a digital video file (or stream) so that it only requires half of the storage space (or network bandwidth) of MPEG-2. Through this compression, the codec is able to maintain the same video quality despite using only half of the storage space.


	The term codec is actually a portmanteau of the words enCOding (coding) and DECoding and describes a process for compressing and decompressing data as files or a real-time stream. For broadcast engineers, a codec usually refers to the compression standard used by a video encoder, decoder or transcoder.

- Compression Standards

Take a video signal to up to 3 gigs/sec HD, squeezes to 1 or 10 mps in an IP stream, takes info and in near real time squeezes it down, taking advantage of compression standards, H264 1000:1, and HEVC or H265 new standard that is 2x as effect, each generation is 2:1 , saving bandwidth or improving quality of bandwidth links.

The H.264 standard is also flexible enough to be applied to a wide variety of applications, networks, and systems, including those with low and high bit rates, low and high resolution video, broadcast, storage, IP packet networks, many types of networks, such as internet, MPLS, satellite, cable, and also ITU-T multimedia telephony systems. H.264 is widely adopted within many verticals and by a wide range of devicesâ€”from professional decoders, all the way down to browsers and mobile devices.

- Compression Principles

Video Compression Standards: mpeg 4 h264 High definition Digital video, AVC - Advanced Video Compression,  h265 all rely on the same principles, estimate motion, resolution and information
represent the same image with the same quality, close to the real raw data that comes in

1mb file reproduce to the same exact file

You may be losing quality depending on how you compress/decompress (spatial point of view), 5mbs vs 2 mbs bandwidth to give the same quality


### Location
Are you located in a place where there is a high demand for transcoding, Europe, North America -- USA.

## Requirements

Before you perform an installation, it is important to understand and be able to address the following requirements for your implementation. 

This is a tutorial for windows, and checking the following will be performed through the Control Panel.


### GPU

- [Nvidia GPU](/video-miners/reference/gpu-support) (the only brand of GPU that works on the Livepeer network) 

- Other GPUs and CPUs
<!-- If you have IRIS, as is common with new Windows machines, or for your preference, `livepeer` does accomodate running  with your CPU but this is not recommended) as it does not provide for maximum performance. -->

Any GPU Nvidia 10 series and up should have NVENC and NVDEC chips. You can find a list of supported [Nvidia GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new), and those supported on the Livepeer network can be found [here]

To find your GPU capacity on your machine


### Network
Understanding of networking and ability to provide internet bandwidth sufficiently robust to stream on Livepeer [Livepeer bandwidth requirements](/video-miners/reference/bandwidth).

#### Internet Bandwidth
Each stream requires about 6Mbs up/down per stream
e.g., 1660 super 20 streams -- 120 Mbs/sec for that video card.

- [Test your bandwidth](/video-miners/reference/bandwidth#test-your-bandwidth)
Upload -- 457 mbps
Download - 24 mbps
- [Calculating your bandwith](https://www.calculator.net/bandwidth-calculator.html) 
- Minimum and Ideal Internet Bandwidth -- 120 mbs
- - Network Knowledge -- Understanding static and dynamic IP addresses, firewalls is necessary as you change configurations during set-up and troubleshooting

#### IP Addresses
**Static IP** -- `Livepeer` will work with a dynamic IP address. However, when receiving streams for broadcasters you will want a static IP to make sure it goes to the same location each time.

To get started, you can use a dynamic IP.

**Firewalls**

**Communication Protocols**  -- How computers talk to eachother

**VPN** 


### LPT -- Livepeer Token

- Required LPT - required [Livepeer token](/protocol/core-concepts/token.md) for staking for those who perform work on the network
- [Livepeer explorer]()
