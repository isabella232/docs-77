This tutorial includes a brief overview of how Livepeer works with contextual information about the steps to setup a Livepeer Orchestrator. 

It aims to guide those new to the Livepeer and are interested in learning about how by participating on the Livepeer network, you can earn passive income utilizing your GPUs for video mining.

## About video mining on Livepeer

Our [Architecture](/video-miners/core-concepts/architecture) allows you to set up various options--architectures to perform video-mining services.

Orchestrator -- is a node set up to work in the Livepeer ecosystem to provide transcoding systems. up with transcoders encoding into pixel rates, e.g. bit rates such as 1080, 720, 

Your GPUs can be set up simply to transcode on the network or you can set up an Orchestrator; a node and transcode work, or include other transcoders who have set up their GPUs to transcode on the network with an Orchestrator.

Ideally, you want your GPU to be able to process as many streams for encoding/transcoding quickly, with the capacity to process streams at the highest resolution possible.

Transcoding takes input as video, decoding to raw formated video and encoding into different formats and bit rates (e.g., 144p,240p , 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p HD) and quality rates (e.g., 0.38 GB/hr, 1.40 GB/hr, 6.84 GB/hr)

You may already be an [ETH Miner](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/#what-is-ethereum-mining) or not.  You can also earn [ETH](https://bitflyer.com/en-us/ethereum-chart) fees if you add your GPU on the Livepeer network to perform transcoding, or run a node with individual or multiple transcoders, using your own GPU(s) or with other transcoders on the network. So, along with or instead of, solving proof-of-work algorithms-- you will earn ETH with your GPU decoding and encoding video.


### Livepeer Explorer

As you familarize yourself with the [Livepeer Explorer](https://explorer.livepeer.org/whats-new) you can visualize Orchestrators and earnings according to performance.

- Optimizing your implementation for increased access

It is important to note that there are 100 slots available for delegating work to orchestrators. Again, you can check the Livepeer Explorer to see how you can fit in.

- Gas fees on L2

You will need ETH as Ethereum covers gas fees. (***See*** LPT2 migration information)


## About Livepeer Installation

The following covers information to keep in mind as you go through the steps of an installation.

It is based on the [How to set up a Livepeer Orchestrator](https://youtu.be/-gfSkX5xL-U)  provided by the [Livepeer Academy](https://livepeer.academy/video-tutorials/)

**Note** This tutorial is for a Windows machine, from which you should be able to glean the information needed for your implementation.

## Considerations and Recommendations

Familiarity with [Livepeer Concepts](/video-miners/core-concepts/overview)

### Transcoding

Device converts video from one format to another, OTT or ABR, one masterfile or mezanine stream to other formats or resolutions, in other words transmit video accross the network to different devices, you use the transcoder to convert video to all formats and resolutions you need to support

After production of a video, it's transcoded in different formats to be sent of a cdn to end user devises, and convert stream over LAN or WAN (network) 

### Encoding and Decoding

Technical understanding of how encoding and decoding works.

- Encoding Types

	- Live

	Live video encoding is the process of compressing large, raw video and audio files so that they use less network bandwidth. When it comes to transporting uncompressed raw video, this can mean a colossal amount of data to send over any connection. Given the constant struggle for bandwidth efficiency, compression significantly reduces the bandwidth required, making it possible for real-time video streams or files to be easily transmitted across constrained networks such as the public internet.

	- File Based

	encoders are used to compress and reduce the size of video content so that it can take up less storage space and be easier to transfer from one part of a video production workflow to another.

	To achieve these levels of compression, video encoders use video compression algorithms known as codecs (such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC) can reduce the raw content data by as much as 1,000 times.

- Codecs
	
	A way to compress and decompress a sequence of images
	For example, A codec based on the H.264 standard compresses a digital video file (or stream) so that it only requires half of the storage space (or network bandwidth) of MPEG-2. Through this compression, the codec is able to maintain the same video quality despite using only half of the storage space.

	The term codec is actually a portmanteau of the words enCOding (coding) and DECoding and describes a process for compressing and decompressing data as files or a real-time stream. For broadcast engineers, a codec usually refers to the compression standard used by a video encoder, decoder or transcoder.

- Compression Standards

	Take a video signal to up to 3 gigs/sec HD, squeezes to 1 or 10 mps in an IP stream, takes info and in near real time squeezes it down, taking advantage of compression standards, H264 1000:1, and HEVC or H265 new standard that is 2x as effect, each generation is 2:1 , saving bandwidth or improving quality of bandwidth links.

	The H.264 standard is also flexible enough to be applied to a wide variety of applications, networks, and systems, including those with low and high bit rates, low and high resolution video, broadcast, storage, IP packet networks, many types of networks, such as internet, MPLS, satellite, cable, and also ITU-T multimedia telephony systems. H.264 is widely adopted within many verticals and by a wide range of devicesâ€”from professional decoders, all the way down to browsers and mobile devices.

- Compression Principles

	Video Compression Standards: mpeg 4 h264 High definition Digital video, AVC - Advanced Video Compression,  h265 all rely on the same principles, estimate motion, resolution and information represent the same image with the same quality, close to the real raw data that comes in 1mb file reproduce to the same exact file. 

	You may be losing quality depending on how you compress/decompress (spatial point of view), 5mbs vs 2 mbs bandwidth to give the same quality


### Location
Are you located in a place where there is a high demand for transcoding, Europe, North America -- USA.

## Requirements

Before you perform an installation, it is important to understand and be able to address the following requirements for your implementation. 

This is a tutorial for windows, and checking the following will be performed through the Control Panel.


### GPU

- [Nvidia GPU](/video-miners/reference/gpu-support) (the only brand of GPU that works on the Livepeer network) 

- Other GPUs and CPUs

If you have IRIS, as is common with new Windows machines, or for your preference, `livepeer` does accomodate running  with your CPU but this is not recommended) as it does not provide for maximum performance.

Any GPU Nvidia 10 series and up should have NVENC and NVDEC chips. You can find a list of supported [Nvidia GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new), and those supported on the Livepeer network can be found [here](https://docs.livepeer.org/video-miners/reference/gpu-support)

To find your GPU capacity on your machine


### Network

Understanding of networking and ability to provide internet bandwidth sufficiently robust to stream on Livepeer [Livepeer bandwidth requirements](/video-miners/reference/bandwidth).

### Internet Bandwidth
Each stream requires about 6Mbs up/down per stream
e.g., 1660 super 20 streams -- 120 Mbs/sec for that video card.

- [Test your bandwidth](/video-miners/reference/bandwidth#test-your-bandwidth)
Upload -- 457 mbps
Download - 24 mbps
- [Calculating your bandwith](https://www.calculator.net/bandwidth-calculator.html) 
- Minimum and Ideal Internet Bandwidth -- 120 mbs
- - Network Knowledge -- Understanding static and dynamic IP addresses, firewalls is necessary as you change configurations during set-up and troubleshooting

### IP Addresses
**Static IP** -- `Livepeer` will work with a dynamic IP address. However, when receiving streams for broadcasters you will want a static IP to make sure it goes to the same location each time.

To get started, you can use a dynamic IP.

**Firewalls**

**Communication Protocols**  -- How computers talk to eachother

**VPN** 


### LPT -- Livepeer Token

- Required LPT - required [Livepeer token](/protocol/core-concepts/token.md) for staking for those who perform work on the network
- [Livepeer Explorer](https://explorer.livepeer.org/)
- Optimization for increased access

There are 100 available slots. In order to see where you can fit in, go to the livepeer explorer to see how 
- Gas fees L2 -- Arbitrum to cover gas fees - (Also ***See*** LPT2 migration information )


### ETH -- Gas Fees

How ETH Works


### Installation Workflow

Depending on your workflow, you may prefer to install `livepeer`
[using a binary release](/installation/install-livepeer/binary-release) or
a [Docker image](/installation/install-livepeer/docker).


**Benchmarking**

**Launching of the network**


### Installation Tutorial


**Scenario:**  Installing `livepeer` on Windows 10 Professional

## Setup/Preparation

Before installing and getting started setting up an Orchestrator node you will need to prepare your graphics card so you can transcode unlimited concurrent streams.

You will have an Encoder and Decoder on your NVIDA Graphics card. 

- Go to [NVIDIA Developers] (https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new)

- Click on the drop down and see all the graphics cards have encoding chips on them.

> **Note** You can also refer to [GPU Support in Livepeer](https://docs.livepeer.org/video-miners/reference/gpu-support)

Check the max concurrent sessions allowed on each card. In order to remove restrictions on the max concurrent sessions allowed, you will patch the driver on your card with a patch tool and a patch for your specific Nvidia driver build, according to the following steps:

> The NVENC patch removes restriction on the maximum number of simultaneous NVENC video encoding sessions imposed by Nvidia to consumer-grade GPUs.

> NvFBC patch (wrapper) allows you to use NvFBC on consumer-grade GPUs. ***See*** [nvfbcwrp](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch/tree/master/win/nvfbcwrp) (clickable) directory for details.

### Patch the NVIDIA driver

1. Download the [patch tool](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch/tree/master/win#nvenc-patch-step-by-step-guide) tool saving the .rar file on your desktop

2. Select and save the version of the patch to your desktop so you can locate it later. This file (1337) should match the [version](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch/tree/master/win#windows-10-drivers) of the driver you have on your computer.


> **Note** You can find your version via your Nvidia Control Panel. Make sure you are running the latest version or update before proceeding further.



3. You can run the patch tool application or manually extract it from the `win.rar` file

Follow the prompt; **locate** and **select** the 1337 patch file you downloaded and saved to your desktop. 


4. and it will prompt you 
for the NVIDIA dll files

c: windows/system32/ scroll to the 
 .dll file open it up and click patch
a confirmation will notify you that the patch has been installed with no errors

all videos on your machine should have unlimited concurrent sessions


5. Download Livepeer and Livepeer Benchmarking tool

In this case it will be `.zip` binary-release for Windows 64bit
And extract the package, and you will see the following application files:

 - `livepeer` file
 - `livepeer_bench` livepeer benchmark application
 - `livepeer_cli` livepeer client application
 - `livepeer_router` livepeer router application


6. Download the rest of the Benchmarking files

	- you can download this [example video](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEtxRk5rcXZxWjRQcHJYc2NhOHZZVGFHNl9yUXxBQ3Jtc0tsd0pPMmdrZnl0N3dXbi1IUk9iRzlONTR3THo0T3NVeXdSZzFfZlpNS1J4VnRfdHlCc1ZFMUEwMW1VY0RKZUptS3NSODZlQ3lGQkU1OXhFZDVKVE9CRmdXTGxPWVV1TXRLMUowS3VFbDRVOGpseHBYdw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Flp_testharness_assets%2Fbbb_1080p_30fps_1min_2sec_hls.tar.gz) to test for benchmarking

	
	or Create your own example videos

	- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) open source open broadcaster software
	Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.

	- Save the [Configuration file](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/cmd/livepeer_bench/transcodingOptions.json) for the benchmark tool into your file folder.

	- click on the raw file and save-as to your folder with the programs in it.

	- bbb folder
	- configuration transcoding .json file
	
	create a batch file to run the benchmarking tool program in orde to be able to know if you patched the video card correctly
	and how well the benchmarking can do based on the video GPU(s) you will be running


	create a .txt file `run benchmark` 
	select it, change the name adding the `.bat`. extension

	add commands to run the benching programs make sure the cases are all correct

```

`livepeer_bench.exe -in bbb/source.m3u8 -transcodingOptions transcodingOptions.json - nvidia slot or type all -concurrentSessions 20
PAUSE

```

it will take all the segments and transcode them with the results on the bottom

in this case, you will be running 20 sessions on all of the GPUs, in this case one GPU

- Metrics
	- **realtime Duration Ratio**, realtime segments ration should be under 0.2 to get performance and not lose any segments
	- othewise, reduce the number of bench marks in your batch file until your reach 0.2

	so in this example you will try 16

> **Note** that if you are running other software using GPU, this will affect the transcoding capacity


	- Open the Firewall to allow the internet to connect to the node, so that when Broadcasters send their livestream they can get throug the firewalls

	-- Open a firewall port
	-- create a new rule
	-- open tcp port 


7. Run the Benchmarking tool

	- s`livepeer_bench`
	-
